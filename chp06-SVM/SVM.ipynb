    "给定训练集样本 $D=\\{(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),...(x_m,y_m)\\}, y\\in\\{-1,+1\\}$,分类学习最基本的想法就是基于训练集D在样本空间中找到一个划分超平面，将不同类别的样本分开。由于数据点都在二维平面上，所以此时分割超平面就是一个平面。更高维的情况可以以此类推。如果数据集是三维的，那么此时用来分割数据的就是一个平面。超平面也就是分类的决策边界，分布在超平面一侧的所有数据都数以某个分类，另一侧的数据则属于另一个类别。\n",
    "\n",
    "如果数据点离决策越远，那么其最后的预测结果也就越可信。我们希望找到离分割超平面最近的点，确保他们离分隔超平面的距离尽可能的大。这里点到分隔面的距离被称为间隔。\n",
